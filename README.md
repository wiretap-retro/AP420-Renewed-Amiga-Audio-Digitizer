## Information
The schematic is per the PDF manual in the respository from the Phoenix Microtechnologies AP420. I added a second RCA jack so you can hook up stereo sound and it will be combined to a mono input. There's also an updated microphone jack that supports TRS 3.5mm and goes to a mono input. The selector switch on the board allows you to select between the RCA input and the microphone input. The AP420 manual also goes into some detail in the notes section for performing component changes to allow for different audio sample rates at the expense of audio quality. VR1 is a gain control knob for adjusting the strength of the audio signal.

## Misc
Not built and tested yet. Feel free to evaluate the circuit and provide any feedback.
